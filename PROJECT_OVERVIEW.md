# Project Overview

## the_board

The project aims to architect and implement a groundbreaking collective intelligence system named **the_board**. This platform will orchestrate a sophisticated team of 20 specialized AI agents, each designed to embody the expertise of a world-class executive leader.

The vision is to establish an unparalleled intellectual powerhouse that translates a user’s high-level, often ambiguous goals into actionable, multi-faceted strategies. The system is architected on three core principles:

1. **Local-First Processing**  
   The system runs entirely on the user’s local machine using frameworks like Ollama. Sensitive information never leaves the user’s control without explicit permission.

2. **Hub-and-Spoke Orchestration**  
   A central agent, the CEO (“Odyssey”), acts as the orchestrator, decomposing complex goals and delegating tasks to specialist agents. This ensures predictable control flow and synthesis of diverse expertise into cohesive output.

3. **Self-Improving System**  
   A dedicated research agent (“Curio”) continuously updates a central knowledge store (ChromaDB). A system-wide feedback loop logs outcomes of major decisions, enabling continuous learning and improved performance.

The system is committed to accessibility, ensuring non-technical users can leverage its power without needing to understand multi-agent collaboration.

## Project Goals and Objectives

**Primary Goal**  
Deliver a fully functional multi-agent system that provides expert-level strategic guidance by transforming high-level user visions into comprehensive, actionable plans.

**Objective 1: Develop the Agent Collective**  

- Architect and implement 20 distinct AI agents as Python classes.  
- Define strict I/O contracts using Pydantic schemas.  
- Configure role-specific LLM parameters (temperature, style).  
- Equip each agent with specialized tools for its role.

**Objective 2: Implement the Orchestration Platform**  

- Build a hub-and-spoke orchestration engine with Odyssey (CEO) as the master controller.  
- Support goal decomposition into sub-tasks.  
- Enable intelligent delegation and parallelization of tasks.  
- Provide state management and error handling.  
- Synthesize final outputs into cohesive strategies, never raw fragments.

**Objective 3: Build the Unified Knowledge Base**  

- Establish ChromaDB as the system-wide memory.  
- Support Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for factual grounding.  
- Automate knowledge maintenance by assigning Curio as sole caretaker.

**Objective 4: Local-First Deployment**  

- Engineer the system to run fully on local infrastructure with Ollama.  
- Guarantee complete user control over data, models, and configuration.

## Control Panel

### Project Scope

### In-Scope

- Development of 20 agent classes in Python with defined roles and schemas.  
- Creation of external role-specific system prompts.  
- Implementation of FastAPI-based orchestration engine.  
- Local deployment with Ollama and ChromaDB.  
- Governance protocols including CEO arbitration and human escalation.  
- A simple web-based UI for interaction.  

### Out-of-Scope (V1)

- Cloud-based LLM API integrations by default.  
- Advanced emergent conflict resolution.  
- Multi-user accounts or collaboration.  
- Proactive agentic behavior (agents initiating tasks independently).  

### Key Stakeholders

- Project Lead / User  
- Future end-users: solopreneurs, creators, developers, strategists  

### Goals and Constraints

- **Goals:** Provide on-demand executive expertise, ensure absolute data privacy, create an efficient self-improving partner.  
- **Constraints:** Must run entirely on local hardware, use Python exclusively for V1, avoid reliance on cloud services.

## High-Level Timeline

**Phase 1 (Months 1–3): Foundation Development**  

- Establish local-first architecture with Ollama, ChromaDB, FastAPI.  
- Implement CEO agent (Odyssey) orchestration loop.  
- Develop core agents: CEO (Odyssey), COO (Momentum), CFO (Abacus), CTO (Nexus).  
- Initialize knowledge base with Curio’s research functions.  

**Phase 2 (Months 4–6): Capability Expansion**  

- Develop the remaining 15 specialist agents.  
- Refine governance protocols (consultations, structured debate).  
- Expand knowledge base with domain-specific materials.  

**Phase 3 (Months 7–12): Optimization and Scale**  

- Optimize performance, stability, and reliability.  
- Enable proactive knowledge curation and stateful memory.  
- Prototype secure optional API integrations.  

---

## Assumptions and Constraints

- **Assumption:** Open-source LLMs via Ollama will be sufficient to create distinct, high-quality agent personas.  
- **Constraint:** Full local deployment is mandatory.  
- **Constraint:** Python is the sole language for initial implementation.  

---

## Success Criteria

- **Agent Functionality:**  
  All 20 agents must be instantiable, pass unit tests for I/O schemas, and perform role-specific tasks correctly.

- **Orchestration Engine Performance:**  
  Success measured by:  
  - *Time-to-Plan:* Average time from goal submission to final plan delivery.  
  - *Delegation Success Rate:* % of sub-tasks completed without retry or escalation.  

- **Collaborative Task Benchmark:**  
  Demonstrate ability to generate a comprehensive SaaS business plan involving at least CEO, CTO, CFO, and CMO. The result must be a single cohesive document.
